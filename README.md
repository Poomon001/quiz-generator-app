Hackathon 2020

I have used PHP, JS, CSS and HTML to create: 
1. An interface of the website 
2. A dynamic table on a homepage
3. A form for manually adding quizzes
4. A quiz page that allow users to attempt the quiz.

In this competition, my partnert have built an auto generated quiz mode:
1. It accepts a txt file.
2. It scans and analzes the txt file to generate a wh-questions according to the uploaded text content.
3. It generates the answers for each questions.
